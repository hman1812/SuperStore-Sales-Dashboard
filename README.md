*Caption: Overview of the Superstore Sales Dashboard.*

## INTRODUCTION
This report looks at sales data from a superstore in the United States. It shows how products and regions are performing, and gives ideas to help grow the business. We focus on sales, profit, regions, and best-selling products.

## OBJECTIVES
The goals of this report are to:
- Understand which products sell best
- Find out which regions make the most and least profit
- Look at how sales have changed over time
- Spot trends and opportunities for growth
- Suggest areas to explore more in future

## OBSERVATIONS
- The dataset has 14 columns and 9,994 rows of information.
- The data comes from a superstore in the U.S.
- It includes both categorical data (like Region, Product Category, and State) and numerical data (like Sales, Quantity, and Profit).
- Phones and Chairs are the top-selling products, bringing in the most money.

## INITIAL INSIGHTS
### Sales and Profit Growth:
From 2014 to 2017, the store's sales and profits increased. The biggest jump was from 2015 to 2016, with sales growing by about $138,673 and profit by $20,176.

### Sales Range by Year:
- Sales ranged from $470,533 to $733,215
- Profit ranged from $49,544 to $93,439

### Top Sub-Categories by Sales:
- Phones: $330,007
- Chairs: $328,449
- Storage: $223,843
- Tables: $206,965
  
### Sales by Region:
- West had the highest sales: $725,458
- South had the lowest sales: $391,722
  
## CONCLUSION
Phones and Chairs are strong products and should stay a key focus to grow sales. To improve performance in weaker regions (like the South), the store could try local ads and partnerships. Studying customer habits and improving how they connect with the brand will also help the store grow over time.
